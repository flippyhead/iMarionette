		<h1>iMarionette</h1>
		<p>Enter your the phone number of your iPhone or iPod Touch and you'll be injected into cuddles the avatar bear for 5 minutes during the Hive-Mind Halloween party.</p>
		<p>You can expect to receive a phone call at some point during the night, possibly more than once. It's up to cuddles how long he wants to keep you in his body.</p>
		<p>Note: interesting though you are, we don't keep these numbers or record the video. This just for fun, yo.</p>
